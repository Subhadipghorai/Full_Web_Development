You have to use an api display the data in from of a card under container. All the data points return by the  API should be converted to card

Use the api: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Hint: 
Create a state for the data which will fetch using the  json placeholder api

Inside useEffect, use fetch to populate that state and then use map to render the cards from that state.
